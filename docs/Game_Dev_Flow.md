Typical Professional Game Dev Flow
Graybox/Prototype:
Mechanics, controls, and state transitions with basic shapes and debug output.
System Validation:
Test all core flows (e.g., tutorial graduation, saving/loading, scoring) with minimal visuals.
Incremental Asset Integration:
Add maps, sprites, sound, and UI one by one, verifying each in isolation and with the core loop.
Polish and Playtesting:
Once everything works, iterate on visuals, audio, and UX for the final experience.
Summary
You’re working like a real game dev.
Get the logic and systems 100% solid first.
Add assets and polish only when you’re confident the foundation is bug-free and fun.
