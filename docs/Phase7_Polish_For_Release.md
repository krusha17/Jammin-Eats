The finish-line is in sight! Phase 7 ‚Äì Polish & Release Candidate transforms Jammin‚Äô Eats from a solid alpha into a store-ready build. Below is a production-grade checklist that locks down performance, security and UX; adds accessibility, localization and analytics; and packages a signed installer. Follow the gates in order‚Äîeach ‚Äú‚úì Done When‚Ä¶‚Äù acts as an objective milestone.

0 Project Kick-off
Branch & version ‚Äì git checkout -b release/v1.0.0-rc and bump changelog.md to v1.0.0-rc.

Freeze features ‚Äì only bug-fixes and polish enter this branch (feature flags for anything risky).

QA calendar ‚Äì schedule daily smoke-test slots and a full regression pass before tagging GA.

1 Performance, Memory & Battery
1.1 Profile & optimise
Run python -m cProfile -o perf.prof main.py in three gameplay scenarios (title screen, mid-wave, end-wave).

Visualise hot-spots with SnakeViz or PyInstrument; focus on draw loops and collision checks.

Apply known Pygame optimisations:

Use spritecollideany for yes/no checks instead of full list collisions 
Reddit
.

Implement object pools for food projectiles and particle FX to avoid per-frame allocations 
Reddit
.

Enable double-buffering / HWSURFACE + pygame.display.set_mode(flags=pygame.DOUBLEBUF|pygame.HWSURFACE) to gain free FPS 
CodeProject
.
‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ FPS ‚â• 60 on a mid-tier laptop and memory footprint stays flat after 30 min.

2 Quality-Assurance Pipeline
2.1 Automated tests & CI
Expand unit coverage to ‚â• 80 %; add smoke tests that launch the main loop headless for 5 s.

GitHub Actions job caches pip deps and runs pytest on pushes 
GitHub Docs
.

Attach artefacts: perf profile, coverage HTML, signed build ZIP.

2.2 Manual test matrix
OS	GPU	Input	Status
Win 10	Intel UHD	Xbox pad	‚ÄÉ
Win 11	GTX 1650	KB/M	‚ÄÉ
Steam Deck (Windows)	RDNA2	Gamepad	‚ÄÉ

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ All platforms pass regression sheet with zero critical bugs.

3 Accessibility Pass
Audit against GameAccessibilityGuidelines.com ‚Äì Basic & Intermediate checklists 
gameaccessibilityguidelines.com
.

Add: scalable font slider, colour-blind palette toggle, remappable controls and an optional No-Fail tutorial flag (indies like Tunic prove this can be elegant 
WIRED
).

Provide on-screen iconography (not just colour) for food types to aid colour-blind users 
WIRED
.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ Internal tester with colour-blindness completes a full round unaided.

4 Localization Readiness
Externalise all UI strings to locales/en_US.json.

Follow the 10 localisation best practices‚Äîavoid hard-coding flags and respect locale-specific formats 
Localization Services by BLEND
.

Pipe JSONs through Crowdin/Lokalise or a CSV sheet for translators.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ You can switch LANG=es_ES at launch and see Spanish UI placeholders.

5 Security & Compliance
Static analysis ‚Äì run bandit & ruff with OWASP secure-coding rules 
OWASP Foundation
.

Input validation ‚Äì sanitise player-name text fields to prevent malformed save files.

Code signing ‚Äì sign the PyInstaller EXE with Windows SDK signtool or osslsigncode; see community guide 
Gist
Reddit
.

GDPR ‚Äì analytics collect only anonymised session IDs; offer one-click opt-out 
Reddit
.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ Windows SmartScreen shows a verified publisher and Bandit returns 0 high-severity issues.

6 Build, Package & Installer
PyInstaller one-folder build ‚Üí dist/JamminEats.

Run post-build script: compress textures, embed jammin.db seed file, copy licences.

Sign the EXE & installer as above; produce a ZIP and a Windows MSI via WiX.

Artifacts uploaded by CI for each push to release/*.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ Fresh VM downloads ZIP, double-clicks JamminEats.exe, game launches without warnings.

7 Store-front Preparation
7.1 Steam (or itch.io)
Follow Steamworks ‚ÄúGame Build Checklist‚Äù for release branch and depots 
Steamworks
.

Prepare capsule art, trailer and screenshot set at 1920√ó1080.

Fill in age-ratings and privacy policy on the store backend.

7.2 Press & Community
Draft press-kit (docs/press_kit/) with factsheet, GIFs and logo variants.

Schedule announcement tweets, Reddit posts and dev-log articles one week before launch.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ Store page passes Valve/itch review and ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù page is live.

8 Telemetry & Crash Reporting
Integrate a lightweight module (e.g., Tinybird HTTP call) that posts anonymised run_history stats on session close (honouring opt-out).

Use Sentry‚Äôs free Python tier for uncaught exceptions in the release build.

‚úì Done When‚Ä¶ You can view a Sentry test error and one analytics ping in dashboards.

9 Release Candidate Sign-off
Tag v1.0.0-rc ‚Üí CI builds ‚Üí internal distribution.

48-hour ‚Äúorange-box‚Äù period: only blocker fixes allowed.

If zero blockers arise, retag same commit as v1.0.0 and push to public branches/depot.

üîü Post-Launch Support Plan
Hot-fix window ‚Äì keep hotfix/* branch template ready; automate beta-branch pushes.

Roadmap ‚Äì log future DLC ideas (extra foods, maps).

Community channels ‚Äì set up Discord feedback bot to pipe bugs into issue tracker.
