To wire in a one-time tutorial, graduation overlay, and a fully-featured title screen (Continue / New Game / Load-5-slots) while keeping everything data-driven and future-proof, follow the checklist below. I note where you‚Äôll likely show me code for review and cite proven patterns in Pygame, SQLite, UI/UX, and state-machine design.

1 High-level flow (what the player sees)
First launch ‚Üí TutorialState (no menu).

Player meets the success target (e.g., earn $50 or 5 perfect deliveries).

‚ÄúTutorial Complete!‚Äù overlay fades in; player presses Enter to acknowledge. 
Stack Overflow
YouTube

Game flips a DB flag, pops to TitleState.

Title now shows Continue ¬∑ New Game ¬∑ Load ¬∑ Quit. Navigation is ‚Äúas-few-clicks-as-possible,‚Äù a key menu UX rule. 
Reddit

Subsequent launches skip TutorialState if the tutorial_complete flag is true ‚Äî Title appears immediately. 
Game Development Stack Exchange

2 DB & persistence changes
2.1 Migration 015_player_profile_tutorial.sql
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE player_profile
    ADD COLUMN tutorial_complete INTEGER DEFAULT 0;   -- 0 = false, 1 = true
Add an index on tutorial_complete for fast lookup (tiny table, but good habit). 
Stack Overflow

2.2 DAL helpers
python
Copy
Edit
def mark_tutorial_complete(pid: int):
    with get_conn() as c:
        c.execute("UPDATE player_profile SET tutorial_complete=1 WHERE player_id=?", (pid,))
        c.commit()

def is_tutorial_complete(pid: int) -> bool:
    with get_conn() as c:
        row = c.execute("SELECT tutorial_complete FROM player_profile WHERE player_id=?", (pid,)).fetchone()
        return bool(row[0])
(Show me dal.py if you want a style or security review later.)

3 Gameplay code additions
3.1 Tutorial success detection
Put the check in TutorialState.update():

python
Copy
Edit
if self.served_correct >= 5:        # or money >= 50
    self.game.push_state(TutorialCompleteState())
Use a finite-state machine so each screen is a class and transitions stay explicit. 
gameprogrammingpatterns.com

3.2 Overlay state
TutorialCompleteState draws a centered panel (‚ÄúTutorial Complete ‚Äì Press Enter‚Äù). On keydown:

python
Copy
Edit
mark_tutorial_complete(self.game.player_id)
self.game.change_state(TitleState())   # reload menu
Use a translucent surface or ThorPy/GUIs if you prefer a GUI helper. 
pygame.org

4 Title screen refactor
4.1 Menu data model
python
Copy
Edit
MENU_NORMAL = [
    {"id": "continue", "text": "Continue", "enabled": is_tutorial_complete(pid)},
    {"id": "new_game",  "text": "New Game"},
    {"id": "load",      "text": "Load"},
    {"id": "quit",      "text": "Quit"},
]
TitleState builds its button list from this dict, so later localisation is trivial. 
Reddit

4.2 Button handlers
Button	Action
Continue	Fetch last save row (ORDER BY save_date DESC LIMIT 1); load via Game.load_from_slot(slot_id).
New Game	dal.create_new_run() ‚Üí launch Level 1 in NormalMode (no tutorial).
Load	Query five most-recent saves (LIMIT 5) and show a sub-menu. 
Stack Overflow

(When you implement the load submenu, send me the UI snippet if you want UX feedback.)

4.3 GUI implementation choices
Roll your own buttons (rect + hover + click) ‚Äî good for full control.

Or integrate a tiny GUI lib (ThorPy / pgu) to shorten code. 
pygame.org

Either way, keep input handling in TitleState only; Main game states never see menu events.

5 Save-slot architecture
Table: saves

Column	Type	Note
slot_id PK	INT	autoincrement
player_id	INT FK	
level_id	TEXT	current frame
money	INT	
owned_upgrades	TEXT (JSON)	fast serialise list
save_date	DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP	

Continue query

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM saves WHERE player_id=? ORDER BY save_date DESC LIMIT 1;
Load-5 screen ‚Äì same query with LIMIT 5, display row per button (level name + date).

Use SQLite parameterised queries to block injection. 
Stack Overflow

Back up jammin.db to Backups/YYYY-MM-DD/ on every save. 
Python for the Lab

6 Testing & QA
Test	Expected
First launch ‚Üí forced tutorial	Yes, Title hidden
Reach goal ‚Üí overlay ‚Üí Enter	DB flag toggled; FPS stable
Relaunch app	Tutorial skipped; Title shows Continue enabled
Continue loads last frame w/ upgrades	Money & stock match
New Game wipes progress but retains DB profile	Starts Level 1 Normal
Load ‚Üí pick slot 3	Exact save restored
Corrupt save row (simulate)	Safe fail (fallback to Title)

Write pytest + headless Pygame where you mock DB rows and assert state-machine transitions.

7 Files I may review next
Feature	Likely files
Overlay & Title menu	states/title_state.py, states/tutorial_complete.py
DB helpers	dal.py, latest migration scripts
Save/load serialiser	game_save.py or save_manager.py
Unit tests	tests/test_title_menu.py, tests/test_save_slots.py

Send them once you stub the code‚ÄîI'll audit for clarity, performance, and security.

You‚Äôre all set for Stage A üéâ
Implement the DB flag, overlay state, title-screen buttons, and save-slot table first. Once these pass the QA grid, we‚Äôll proceed to Stage B (upgrade catalogue lock-in). Ping me when you want the next step or code review!
