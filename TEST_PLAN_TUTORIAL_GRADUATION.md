# Tutorial Graduation System Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the testing approach for the Jammin' Eats Tutorial Graduation System. The system allows new players to learn game mechanics in a forgiving environment and then transition to normal gameplay once they've met specific goals.

## Test Environments

- **Development**: Local Windows environment with Python 3.8+
- **Testing**: Clean installation on Windows with minimal dependencies

## Test Execution

### Test Procedure

1. Run unit tests with pytest
2. Execute integration tests manually following test scripts
3. Conduct UX testing with sample users
4. Run regression tests to ensure no functionality is broken

### Test Data

- Clean database with new player profile
- Database with existing player profile (tutorial complete)
- Database with existing player profile (tutorial incomplete)

## Defect Management

- Log all defects with reproducible steps
- Categorize by severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Cosmetic)
- Include screenshots or videos when possible

## Exit Criteria

- All unit and integration tests pass
- No critical or major defects remain
- UX testing shows clear understanding of tutorial flow

## Test Reporting

- Generate test summary with pass/fail counts
- Document any workarounds implemented
- Provide recommendations for future improvements
